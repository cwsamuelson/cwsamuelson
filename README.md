## Hello there! 👋
I'm a big nerd 🤓, and senior software developer 🖥️.

I work on personal projects for topics I'm interested in.  Currently that includes:
- Graphics
- Game engines
- Programming languages
- Best practices
  - Especially different kinds of testing
  - This primarily has the end goal to support the other stuff

I'm very knowledgeable in C++/systems, and want to learn Rust🦀!
